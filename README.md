# Example of a shell script that monitors system CPU, RAM, and disk usage:

Save the above script to a file (e.g., system_monitor.sh), make it executable (chmod +x system_monitor.sh), and then run it (./system_monitor.sh). The script will continuously monitor the system's CPU usage, RAM usage, and disk usage in an infinite loop with a 5-second interval between each check.

Please note that this script provides a basic example of system monitoring and may need customization based on your specific requirements or the tools available on your system.
